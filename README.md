# Scapy Hands-on at #GreHack


## Description

[Scapy](https://www.scapy.net), is a powerful Python-based interactive packet manipulation program and library. It can be used to forge or decode packets for a wide number of protocols, send them on the wire, capture them, match requests and replies, and much more.

This repository contains small exercises (or trophies) that gives you the opportunity to enhance your Scapy skills by manipulating yourself and watching a potential solution!
